## Homebridge plugin for Raspberry Pi
Copyright © 2019-2020 Erik Baauw. All rights reserved.

This [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin exposes a
Raspberry Pi to HomeKit.
It provides the following features:

- Monitoring from HomeKit the Pi's CPU: temperature, frequency, voltage,
and throttling, incl. [Eve](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-app) history for
the temperature;
- Monitoring and controlling from HomeKit the Pi's GPIO pins;
- Monitoring and controlling from HomeKit a
[Fan SHIM](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/fan-shim) installed in the Pi.

Unlike most other Raspberry Pi plugins, homebridge-rpi runs on any regular
Homebridge setup, connecting to the Pi's `pigpiod` daemon over the network.
In particular, homebridge-rpi:
- Exposes multiple Raspberry Pi computers from one Homebridge instance;
- Does _not_ need to run on a Raspberry Pi;
- Does _not_ require any C components;
- Does _not_ require `root` privilege.

### Work in Progress
Note that this plugin is still under development.
Todo:
- ~~Handle connection errors to remote `pigpiod` instead of crashing;~~
- ~~Expose current server when running on a Raspberry Pi;~~
- Specify other Raspberry Pi computers in `config.json`;
- Specify GPIO pin assignment in `config.json`;
- Support PWM;
- Support Fan SHIM button (and other buttons);
- Support NeoPixel LEDs.

Sometimes, the homebridge-rpi plugin doesn't properly close the `pigpiod` file
handles.
This can result in an `FO (104): error no handle available (-24)` error.
Use `rpi -H xx.xx.xx.xx closeHandles` to force-close the stale handles.
Note that `rpi` is installed by default to `./homebridge/node_modules/.bin/rpi`

### Prerequisites
You need a server to run Homebridge.
This can be anything running [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): a Raspberri Pi,
a NAS system, an always-on PC running Linux, macOS, or Windows, or even a
Docker container.
See the [homebridge Wiki](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/wiki) for
details.
I use a Raspberri Pi 3B+, and, occasionally a Mac mini server.
Note that I develop and test against the latest LTS release of Node.js.

The homebridge-rpi plugin connects (locally or remotely) to the
[`pigpiod`](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpiod.html) daemon
on the Raspberry Pi.
It uses the [Socket Interface](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/sif.html),
just as the [`pigs`](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigs.html) command.
This daemon is part of the [`pigpio`](https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio)
library, which is included in Raspbian.
While this daemon comes with Raspbian, it needs to be enabled and
configured for use by homebridge-rpi, see [**Installation**](#installation).
<br>If you run Homebridge in a container on the Raspberry Pi, let
homebridge-rpi connect to `pigpiod` running on the host.
Do _not_ try to run `pigpiod` in the container.

To interact with HomeKit, you need Siri or a HomeKit app on an iPhone,
Apple Watch, iPad, iPod Touch, or Apple TV (4th generation or later).
I recommend to use the latest (non-beta) version of the OS.
<br>Please note that Siri and even Apple's
[Home](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204893) app still provide only limited
HomeKit support.
To use the full features of homebridge-rpi, you might want to check out some
other HomeKit apps,
like [Eve](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-app) (free) or
[Home 3](https://hochgatterer.me/home/) (paid).
<br>To interact with HomeKit remotely and for HomeKit automations, you need to
setup an Apple TV (4th generation or later), HomePod, or iPad as
[home hub](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207057).

### Command-Line Tool
The `homebridge-rpi` plugin comes with a command-line tool, `rpi`,
for interacting with the `pigpiod` daemon. `rpi` is installed by default to `./homebridge/node_modules/.bin/rpi`
It takes a `-h` or `--help` argument to provide a brief overview of
its functionality and command-line arguments.

### Installation
To install homebridge-rpi, issue:
```
$ sudo npm -g i homebridge-rpi
```
on the server or container running Homebridge.

In homebridge's config.json you need to specify homebridge-rpi as a platform plugin:
```
"platforms": [
  {
    "platform": "Rpi"
  }
]
```

Note that you need to execute the following steps on each of the Raspberry Pi
computers you want homebridge-rpi to expose.

#### Configure `pigpiod` Service
Raspbian comes with a service definition for `pigpiod`, in
`/lib/systemd/system/pigpiod.service`.
By default `pigpiod` won't accept remote connections, due to the `-l` option.
To enable remote connections, run `sudo raspi-config` and set _Remote GPIO_ (P8)
under _Interfacing Options_ (5).
This will create a drop-in configuration in
`/etc/systemd/system/pigpiod.service.d/public.conf`, removing the `-l` option.
After that, reload the daemon by:
```
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

#### Enable `pigpiod` Service
To enable and start `pigpiod` as a service, issue:
```
$ sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
$ sudo systemctl start pigpiod
```
To check that the service is running, issue:
```
$ pigs hwver
10494163
```
This returns the Pi's hardware revision (in decimal).

To check that the service is accepting remote connections, run `pigs` on
another Raspberry Pi:
```
$ PIGPIO_ADDR=xx.xx.xx.xx pigs hwver
10494163
```
substituting `xx.xx.xx.xx` with the IP address of the remote Raspberry Pi.

#### Install `vcgencmd` Script
`pigpio` provides a hook to execute a shell command remotely.
homebridge-rpi uses this hook to run a little shell script,
[`vcgencmd`](./opt/pigpio/cgi/vcgencmd), that calls `vcgencmd` to get the
Pi's CPU temperature, frequency, voltage, and throttling information.
This script needs to be installed to `/opt/pigio/cgi` by:
```
$ sudo sh -c 'cat > /opt/pigpio/cgi/vcgencmd <<+'
#!/bin/bash
# homebridge-rpi/opt/pigpio/cgi/vcgencmd
# Copyright © 2019 Erik Baauw.  All rights reserved.
#
# Homebridge plugin for Raspberry Pi.

umask 022
exec 2> /opt/pigpio/vcgencmd.err
exec > /opt/pigpio/vcgencmd.out

echo -n "{"
echo -n "\"date\":\"$(date -uIseconds)\","
echo -n "\"load\":$(uptime | sed -e "s/.*load average: \([^ ]*\),.*/\1/"),"
echo -n "\"temp\":$(vcgencmd measure_temp | sed -e "s/temp=\(.*\)'C/\1/"),"
echo -n "\"freq\":$(vcgencmd measure_clock arm | cut -f 2 -d =),"
echo -n "\"volt\":$(vcgencmd measure_volts | sed -e "s/volt=\(.*\)V/\1/"),"
echo -n "\"throttled\":\"$(vcgencmd get_throttled | cut -f 2 -d =)\""
echo -n "}"
+
$ chmod 755 /opt/pigpio/cgi/vcgencmd
```
To check that the script has been installed correctly, issue:
```
$ pigs shell vcgencmd
0
```
The return status `0` indicates success.
This should have created two output files in `/opt/pigpio`:
```
$ ls -l /opt/pigpio
total 12
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  152 Aug 19 11:51 access
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Aug 19 11:53 cgi
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    0 Aug 19 11:53 vcgencmd.err
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  114 Aug 19 11:53 vcgencmd.out
```
The `.err` file should be empty.
The `.out` file contains the script's output in JSON:
```
$ json vcgencmd.out
{
  "date": "2019-08-19T09:53:54+00:00",
  "load": 0.23,
  "temp": 42.9,
  "freq": 1400000000,
  "volt": 1.3688,
  "throttled": "0x80000"
}
```

#### File Access
`pigpio` provides a hook to access files remotely.
homebridge-rpi uses this hook to get the Raspberry Pi's serial number from
`/proc/cpuinfo` and to get the output from the `vcgencmd` script.
These files need to be whitelisted, in `/opt/pigpio/access`:
```
$ sudo sh -c 'cat - > /opt/pigpio/access' <<+
/proc/cpuinfo r
/opt/pigpio/vcgencmd.out r
+
```

To check that the files can be read, issue:
```
$ pigs fo /opt/pigpio/vcgencmd.out 1
0
$ pigs -a fr 0 1024
114 {"date":"2019-08-19T09:53:54+00:00","load":0.23,"temp":42.9,"freq":1400000000,"volt":1.3688,"throttled":"0x80000"}
$ pigs fc 0
```
The `fo` command opens the file for reading, returning a file descriptor, `0`
in this example.
This file descriptor is passed to the `fr` and `fc` commands.
The `fr` commands reads up to 1024 bytes from the file,
and prints them as ascii.
The `fc` command closes the file.

#### Automatic Discovery
I run my Raspberry Pi machines headless (without a monitor, keyboard, or mouse),
using VNC to access the desktop remotely.
The VNC server comes pre-installed with Raspbian.
Clients connect to it using the Remote Frame Buffer protocol,
which is also used by macOS screen sharing.
To use macOS screen sharing, the VNC server needs to be
configured with a VNC password (rather than a UNIX password).

I've configured the `avahi` daemon my Raspberry Pi machines to
advertise the VNC server over Bonjour, so macOS will find them automatically.
This is done by creating `rfb.service` in `/etc/avahi/services` and restarting
the daemon:
```
$ sudo sh -c 'cat - > /etc/avahi/services/rfb.service' <<+
<?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?>
<!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
<service-group>
	<name replace-wildcards="yes">%h</name>
	<service>
		<type>_rfb._tcp</type>
		<port>5900</port>
	</service>
</service-group>
+
$ sudo systemctl restart avahi-daemon
```
The homebridge-rpi plugin listens for these Bonjour to find Raspberry Pi
machines on the local network.
